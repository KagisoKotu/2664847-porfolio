            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Kagiso Kotu, and I am a technology student with a strong interest in web
                development and software design. I enjoy learning how to build clean, structured,
                and user-friendly websites using modern web technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am passionate about continuously improving my skills and staying up to date with
                emerging trends in technology. My goal is to grow as a developer while creating
                meaningful and efficient digital solutions.

            <h3>Latest Project</h3>
            <p>
                My latest project is a personal portfolio website created using semantic HTML5.
                The goal of this project is to present my profile, skills, and projects in a clear
                and accessible way. The site uses proper semantic elements such as header, nav,
                section, article, and footer to improve readability, structure, and accessibility.
                This project serves as a foundation that can later be enhanced with CSS styling
                and JavaScript interactivity.
